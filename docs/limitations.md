# Limitations

CircuitCI is a validation runtime, not a full EDA suite.

The runtime backbone is Rust. Python is not part of the production engine path.

## Not Implemented

- schematic editing
- PCB layout editing
- GHz RF or antenna solving
- DDR or high-speed signal integrity solving
- full USB PHY simulation
- full SMPS compensation design
- automatic datasheet-to-perfect-model generation
- firmware-in-loop functional MCU backend execution

## Current Technical Limits

- Full transistor-level MCU simulation is intentionally not a CircuitCI goal.
  MCU models should be functional black boxes at the board boundary: firmware
  execution, reset/boot behavior, peripheral state, pin modes, electrical pin
  limits, thresholds, clamps, leakage, and timing that matter to the surrounding
  circuit.
- `firmware_in_loop` scenarios currently validate their declared target,
  firmware image, and expected board-facing pin behavior, then fail closed with
  `FUNCTIONAL_MCU_FIRMWARE` until a supported functional runtime backend such
  as Renode or QEMU is integrated.
- Behavioral power states are declared in Board IR rather than inferred from a
  whole-board analog power-tree simulation.
- `GPIO_BACKDRIVE` uses a simple diode/source-resistance approximation.
- Quantitative waveform proof is available only through `analog_transient`
  scenarios with a SPICE-class backend and explicit assertions.
- Imported SPICE decks can produce solver and waveform evidence, but an
  assertion-free imported deck reports `ANALOG_ASSERTIONS_ABSENT`; waveform
  evidence alone is not design sign-off.
- KiCad XML and native `.kicad_sch` import are conservative. Unsupported or
  ambiguous constructs fail closed instead of being guessed.
- Component models are low-confidence generic behavioral models unless a vendor
  or datasheet-backed pack says otherwise.
- Reports include `LOW_CONFIDENCE_MODEL` limitations for `generic`, `estimated`, or `low` confidence models used by a project.
- `RESIDENT_BOOTLOADER_UPDATE_SEQUENCE` validates declared transaction traces and does not execute firmware, decode raw serial frames, recompute CRCs, emulate flash, or prove HIL behavior.
- `CONTROL_LINE_RELEASE_SEQUENCE` validates declared line effects and release delays and does not solve transistor storage, hidden RC networks, or physical modem-pin voltage truth tables.
- `analog_transient` scenarios are the only path intended for quantitative
  voltage/current waveform proof. If no SPICE-class backend is available, or if
  the solver cannot produce parseable waveform data, these scenarios fail with
  critical analog findings rather than producing fake passes.

Reports must include these limitations so automated agents and human users know when a pass does not imply full physical coverage.
